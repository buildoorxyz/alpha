# Buildoor - Onboard, Engage, Retain Users in Web3

**Buildoor** is a **no-code tool** to create **Incentivized and Immersive product experiences** via **Layovers**.

### Buildoor Solves

- Complicated User Onboarding - Web3 dApps, in general, donâ€™t have a defined user onboarding flow.
- Dapps have complex UI/UX - Web3 dAapps are very complex and difficult for the average user to use.
- Low User Retention - Users visit the website but then are intimidated by the complex functionality.
- High CAC for Dapps - This results in high CAC for dApps and creates challenges for user retention.
- Privacy-focused wallet-based analytics - User privacy is not kept in mind while tracking them.

To tackle all these issues, we are building - A no-code tool to create - Gamified & Incentivized Immersive Product experiences via Layovers. 

Here,
- User does not navigate away
 - Gets familiar with the product & features
- Incentivized to explore and interact with the product
- dApps gets analytics dashboard w/ user journey insights
- User earns XPs, NFTs, SBTs & Token bounties to explore and provide product feedback

The main aim of Buildoor lies in simplifying the usage of dApps via gamified and immersive experiences and delivering user journey insights to the dApps in order to optimize user onboarding, user experience, and other features within the application.

## About Immersive Product Experience

_It will act as a layer on top of any dApp, simplifying user onboarding and guiding users to interact with product features._

It is an interactive dApp experience that helps and encourages the user to perform tasks/activities like connecting the wallet, performing a token swap (for Dex), lending - borrowing assets (In the case of Defi), playing a game, etc. Tasks/activities may vary as per the dApp use case and features.

While going through the immersive experience, users can rate and provide feedback for dApps, for example: what step they found complicated, the easiness of using the dApp, etc.

On top of the immersive experience, dApps will have a user analytics dashboard that will provide dApps with valuable insights on user-dApp interaction tracked via heatmaps, the average time taken to perform a certain task or activity, feedback given by users, and other information to help dApps improve (added over time).

## Why Does Web3 needs Buildoor?

Web3 ecosystem currently does not have a unified solution to onboard and acquire users via Layovers. Buildoor takes advantage of the layovers (a concept widely used in every web2 product). We combine the most engaging aspects of web2 (layovers) and web3 (incentives) under one roof to deliver an unmatched user onboarding and engagement, and retention magnet.

Currently the products to drive user growth and engagement are incentives driven, with the main focus on web3 native users only. They have tutorials in the form of text, screenshots and videos to guide a user to perform specific tasks on a dApp. 

With Buildoor, the user will follow an immersive product guide to perform a certain task, thus reducing the bounce rate, making the user understand the product and providing motivation in the form of incentives to keep using the product and express their genuine feedback. 

We provide a no-code tool to create an immersive product experience (here, marketing managers or any team member of the projects can come on our platform and create their dApps/product's immersive experience by simply drag & drop. With our fellow competitors in web3, everything is manual and hence requires a lot of time and effort to make tutorials (content) and integrate it within their platform. 

Furthermore, we also provide projects/dApps with analytics that encompass user journeys and give insights such as average time taken to perform actions, complicated actions, onboarding feedback, and other analytics tracked via heatmap and analyzing on-chain activities of the wallet. 

There's an issue of bad web transactions in web3 that breaks the user experience entirely, and eventually, the user never returns. Consider Buildoor as your virtual mentor who takes care of the user's on-chain activity and makes sure everything is going smoothly. 

Using Buildoor's immersive product experience, even a web2 user can easily understand and perform complicated tasks such as bridging cross-chain assets, swapping, lending and borrowing tokens, creating investment pools, farming, staking, etc.
